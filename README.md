### README: Technology Sector Portfolio Analysis (2017–2022)

#### Overview
This project evaluates the financial performance, risk, and optimization of key technology stocks: Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Google (GOOGL/Alphabet Inc.). The NASDAQ-100 Technology Sector Index (NDXT) serves as a sector benchmark.

#### Objectives
- Analyze individual and cumulative stock performance.
- Construct optimized portfolios using Mean-Variance and Tangency Portfolio methodologies.
- Evaluate risk through CAPM, VaR, and Expected Shortfall (ES).

#### Key Findings
1. **Portfolio Optimization**:
   - **Minimum Variance Portfolio**:
     - Allocations: MSFT (50.2%), GOOGL (30.8%), AAPL (26.0%), AMZN (-7.1%).
     - Sharpe Ratio: 1.29 (2017–2019), outperforming the sector (0.956).
   - **Tangency Portfolio**:
     - Allocations: MSFT (119.06%), AAPL (49.93%), GOOGL (-73.78%), AMZN (4.79%).
     - Sharpe Ratio: 1.643 (2017–2019) and 0.453 (2020–2022), consistently superior to the sector.

2. **Risk Analysis**:
   - **CAPM**:
     - 2017–2019: Tangency Portfolio and MSFT showed significant alpha, high beta (>1), and outperformed CAPM predictions.
     - 2020–2022: Reduced beta and insignificant alpha due to pandemic-driven market shifts.
   - **VaR & ES**:
     - Sector risk increased during 2020–2022, with VaR and ES reflecting heightened volatility, particularly for AMZN.

3. **Performance Trends**:
   - Tangency Portfolio consistently outperformed the sector, achieving higher cumulative returns and Sharpe Ratios, even during COVID-19-induced volatility.

#### Tools & Methods
- **Optimization**: Markowitz Mean-Variance, Tangency Portfolio with Sharpe Ratio maximization.
- **Risk Assessment**: CAPM, VaR, ES, and Security Market Line (SML) analysis.
- **Visualization**: Efficient frontier, cumulative return, and SML plots.

#### Conclusion
The Tangency Portfolio demonstrated robust performance, leveraging MSFT and AAPL to optimize risk-return trade-offs. The analysis highlights the resilience of the technology sector during market turbulence and emphasizes the value of portfolio optimization for superior risk-adjusted returns.
